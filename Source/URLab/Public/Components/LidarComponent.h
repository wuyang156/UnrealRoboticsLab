/**
 * @class ULidarComponent
 * @brief Engine-agnostic spinning-raycast lidar: works in plain Unreal, no
 * physics-engine coupling.
 *
 * The component owns the lidar computation and, on its own, never reads
 * physics data from any source: every scan takes its cartesian pose from the
 * component's own world transform and raycasts the Unreal collision world
 * (UWorld::LineTraceSingleByChannel). Attach it under any actor or component
 * hierarchy and it senses whatever that hierarchy makes of its pose — in a
 * plain UE scene that is simply where you placed it.
 *
 * Physics-engine adapters replace the ray source instead: UMjLidarSensor
 * (MuJoCo) overrides HasExternalScanSource and produces each scan against the
 * compiled MuJoCo model on the physics thread (mj_multiRay — the simulation's
 * ground truth), streaming pose, ray directions, and ranges into the core's
 * PublishRayResults on the game thread. The core's post-processing (points,
 * targets, publishing) is shared by both ray sources.
 *
 * Data path (all game thread unless noted):
 *  1. TickComponent rate-limits scans on the scan clock (GetScanTimeSeconds);
 *     adapters with an external ray source skip this — they schedule scans
 *     themselves (UMjLidarSensor gates on MuJoCo simulation time).
 *  2. The beam grid is expanded (plus angular noise), each beam is a single
 *     LineTrace along MaxRange on TraceChannel; hits closer than MinRange
 *     after range noise fall in the blind zone and are dropped.
 *  3. Hits become FLidarPoints (world space, centimetres), optionally
 *     cluster into targets, and the completed FLidarScan broadcasts on
 *     OnLidarScan. Published scans contain hits only — misses are omitted.
 *
 * Beam convention (sensor-local frame): azimuth sweeps around the sensor's
 * local +Z (up), elevation is positive above the local X-XY plane, and
 * azimuth/elevation of 0/0 points along the sensor's local +X. The
 * full-circle azimuth grid is endpoint-exclusive; partial grids are
 * endpoint-inclusive; a single beam sits at the midpoint of its range.
 *
 * Cost note: rays are serial LineTraces on the game thread. A few thousand
 * beams per scan is comfortable; five-digit beam counts (e.g. dense Ouster
 * presets) are functional but can take milliseconds per scan.

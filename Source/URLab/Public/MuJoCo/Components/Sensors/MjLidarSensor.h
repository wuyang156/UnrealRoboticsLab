/**
 * @class UMjLidarSensor
 * @brief MuJoCo adapter over the engine-agnostic ULidarComponent core: the
 * ray source is the compiled MuJoCo model.
 *
 * The core (ULidarComponent) owns every engine-agnostic part of the lidar —
 * beam grid, noise, blind zone, target aggregation, publishing — and works
 * standalone against the Unreal collision world. This adapter replaces the
 * ray source with the simulation's ground truth and keeps all MuJoCo
 * knowledge here:
 *
 *  - Rays: mj_multiRay against the compiled model, run inside the physics
 *    engine's post-step callback (physics thread, CallbackMutex held), so
 *    the lidar sees exactly what MuJoCo sees — quick-converted props,
 *    imported robots' collision geoms, the floor. A plain UE actor with no
 *    MuJoCo presence is invisible to it, by design.
 *  - Pose: the nearest UMjBody or UMjSite ancestor is the mount; the sensor
 *    frame is composed from the mount's MuJoCo pose and this component's
 *    mount-relative transform, read from mjData on the physics thread. With
 *    no MuJoCo ancestor the sensor falls back to a static world mount using
 *    the component's world pose captured at resolve time.
 *  - Scheduling: scans are rate-limited on MuJoCo simulation time (d->time)
 *    inside the callback, so ScanFrequencyHz honours pauses and sim-speed
 *    changes for free.
 *
 * Data path follows docs/concepts/architecture.md: the physics thread writes
 * each raw scan into a mutex-guarded buffer (the game thread never touches
 * mjData); TickComponent drains the newest scan, converts the sensor pose to
 * Unreal coordinates, and hands the beam results to the core's shared
 * PublishRayResults, which builds points, aggregates targets, and broadcasts
 * OnLidarScan on the game thread.
 *
 * Beam convention (sensor-local frame): azimuth sweeps around the sensor's
 * local +Z (up), elevation is positive above the local X-XY plane, and
 * azimuth/elevation of 0/0 points along the sensor's local +X.

	 * MjPlane floors and MJCF-imported geoms without a group override default
	 * to group 0. Default 9 = groups 0 + 3: senses collision hulls plus
	 * default-group geometry (floor, primitives) while excluding visual-only
	 * group 2, so a mesh with both visual and collision geoms is never
